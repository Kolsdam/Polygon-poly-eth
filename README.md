# NFT Bridge

This project showcases the process of creating unique digital artworks based on ERC721 standards and transferring them from Ethereum (ETH) to Polygon (Matic) via a bridge. The central contract utilized is an ERC721A contract, an extension of the ERC721 smart contract named `DamToken`, enabling the minting of digital artworks on both Ethereum and Polygon networks.

## Technologies Utilized

- **Solidity:** This project employs Solidity as the programming language for developing the CreativeToken ERC721 contract.
- **Hardhat:** Hardhat serves as the primary development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- **DALL-E:** DALL-E is a state-of-the-art AI model developed by OpenAI, capable of generating artwork from textual prompts. In this project, DALL-E was utilized to create the digital artworks hosted on IPFS.
- **IPFS:** IPFS functions as a decentralized storage solution for hosting the digital artwork associated with each NFT.
- **FxPortal:** FxPortal acts as a protocol enabling seamless interoperability between various blockchain networks, facilitating the transfer of assets between Ethereum and Polygon.

## Instructions for Minting and Transferring NFTs

0. Clone or download the project and execute `npm install` to install all prerequisite dependencies.

1. **Minting NFTs:** Deploy the CreativeToken contract to the Goerli Ethereum testnet by running `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli`. Mint NFTs using the `npx hardhat run scripts/mintAll.js --network goerli` command. You can specify the quantity of NFTs to be minted for an address by adjusting the `noOfNFTs` variable within the "mint.js" script.

2. **Uploading Images to IPFS:** Employ [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) to upload the folder containing NFT images to IPFS and obtain the _baseURI_ of your IPFS directory.

3. **Authorization and Transfer:** Authorize and transfer your NFTs to the Polygon network via the FxERC721RootTunnel contract. Utilize `npx hardhat run scripts/approve.js --network goerli` to execute this process.

4. **Confirmation and Wait:** Allow a brief period (approximately 20-30 minutes) for the tokens to reflect in your Polygon account following the deposit.

5. **Verification of Balance:** Verify the successful transfer of NFTs by employing `npx hardhat run scripts/getBalance.js --network mumbai` to check the number of NFTs associated with an address on Polygon.

## Checking Artwork Descriptions

To explore the textual descriptions linked with each NFT artwork, execute the `npx hardhat run scripts/prompt.js --network goerli` command subsequent to deploying the CreativeToken contract.

## Accessing NFT Specifications

Post successful minting of NFTs via the CreativeToken contract, effortlessly access the specifications of each NFT utilizing the `npx hardhat run scripts/nftDescription.js --network goerli` command.

The script will present the following details for each NFT: the unique identifier of the NFT, the textual prompt description used to generate the corresponding NFT artwork using DALL-E, the address of the NFT owner, the URI linked with the NFT, the public URL where the NFT artwork can be viewed on IPFS.

You can modify the `tokenId` variable within the `nftDetail.js` script to inspect the details of different NFTs.
